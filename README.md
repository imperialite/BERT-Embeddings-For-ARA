# BERT Embeddings for Automatic Readability Assessment

This repository contains the script for extracting BERT embeddings for a corpus of text documents for the automatic readability assessment task (ARA) used in the paper [Knowledge-Rich BERT Embeddings for Readability Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07935) accepted at RANLP 2021. 

The script is in Python notebook and can be run seamlessly in Google Colab. The code is also verbose and will walk you through each step. 


If you are going to use the code, please cite the paper:
